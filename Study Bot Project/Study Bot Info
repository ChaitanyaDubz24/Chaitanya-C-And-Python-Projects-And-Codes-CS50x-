For many university students, studying takes up a sizable portion of their lives. Resulting in them
falling victim to procrastination and digital distractions. Studies have shown that cell phone usage and
poor time management are among the lead causes of reduced academic productivity. To address the
problem, our group developed The Procrastinot. A physical study companion that combines beneficial
time management techniques with behavioral reinforcements. The Proctrastinot utilizes the Pomodoro
technique, timing twenty-five-minute study sessions followed by a five-minute break to promote
sustained focus. To encourage and enforce positive study habits, the Procrastinot rewards users with a
sweet treat after completing each cycle, while discouraging distractions by launching a piece of ‘trash’ at
the user if they lose focus. The device also features a ‘phone jail’ compartment to lock up the user's
phone, removing a primary source of distraction. Lastly, the user can request the generation of a random
quote to provide extra encouragement when needed.
